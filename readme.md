# A LaTeX template repository with Vim compatible snippets

## The best LaTeX templates (article, book, report, beamer, resume and more) coupled with simple snippets for the UltiSnip plugin

Required plugins: 

1. Vim plugin manager (Vundle Pathogen etc)
2. UltiSnip plugin (which in turn requires Python 3 in your Vim)
3. (optional) YouCompleteMe --- a stupendous autocomplete plugin for Vim, that
unfortunately requires a lot of dependencies and a seperate python installation.
